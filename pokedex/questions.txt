--- why do we need to bind this in the whiteboarding question for student A
--- why do we call the requestAPokemon function in the presentation component on this.props instead of how it's defined?
--- how does pokemonID get extracted and know how to pull out the actual id number?
--- bug we're facing now
--- do we need to pass in the store to the root.jsx file (doesn't in solution)
--- key id not needed in the LI pokemon_index_item component and fine to just have in the array in the pokemon_index file level?

-- why does render in pokemon_detail set this.props to undefined?
